# Requirements for a GPA Calculator

1. A GPA calculator would be hosted on the website http://www.umsl.edu/advising as a resource for students, faculty and staff to help students project their gpa over the course of the semester. The calculator would help students who would need a specific gpa to meet academic policies such as probation, latin honors, or minimum gpa’s for admission to upper level courses.

2. The calculator should be web-based.  An mobile device version would be desirable but not necessary

3. We would like this calculator modeled after  http://ls-commons.berkeley.edu/gpa_calc.html

4. The calculator would start with the current GPA and number of credit hours with a letter grade. (S, U, EX, EX-F, and Y do not count in a GPA)

5. The projected grade and credit hours would be entered for each course. A student can have the option to substitute a grade if the student is repeating the course.  The grade points and credit hours would need to be removed for the previous grade and the projected grade would be used.

6. The questions “Repeat?” should default to  “No”

7. The “Previous Grade” list should be C-, D+, D, D-, F, and FN.

8. The Grade Points will appear in their own column. Grade points = credit hours multiplied by grade value

9. A projected GPA with credit hours will appear after the form is completed and a submit button is clicked. 

10. A reset button should also be added clearing the form

11. The formula for a g.p.a is the sum of grade points divided by credit hours. 

12. Here are the grade values for UMSL:
```
[A]  => 4.0
[A-] => 3.7
[B+] => 3.3
[B]  => 3.0
[B-] => 2.7
[C+] => 2.3
[C]  => 2.0
[C-] => 1.7
[D+] => 1.3
[D]  => 1.0
[D-] => 0.7
[F]  => 0
[FN] => 0
```
13. A “What GPA would I need to get X GPA?” option would be nice but not necessary. Students would enter the remaining credit hours and desired gpa.  An average gpa would be displayed.
